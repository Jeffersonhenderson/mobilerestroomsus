                <h2 class="template4 h2alooma" style="margin-left: 400px; font-size: larger; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:medium;">1. What if my event location is remote and has no access to water or power?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">That's no problem at all. All of our standard and deluxe portable restrooms in #State are completely self-contained. They do not require any external water or power connections. Even our luxury restroom trailers can be outfitted with onboard freshwater tanks and quiet generators to operate in fully off-grid locations.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">2. How do you determine the final cost for a porta potty?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">The final porta potty rental cost in #State is based on three main factors: the type of unit you choose (a luxury trailer is more than a standard unit), the duration of your rental (a month-long rental has a lower per-day cost than a one-day rental), and the delivery distance to your location. Our quotes are always transparent and all-inclusive.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">3. What is your cleaning and sanitization process between rentals?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">We have a rigorous, multi-step process. Every unit is completely evacuated, then power-washed inside and out with a hospital-grade disinfectant. We pay special attention to all high-touch surfaces. It's then air-dried, restocked with fresh, sealed supplies, and given a final quality control inspection before itâ€™s certified "ready to rent.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">4. Can I choose the color of my portable toilet?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">While we cannot guarantee a specific color, we do maintain a fleet in a variety of standard colors (like blue, green, and gray). For events where aesthetics are a key concern, such as weddings, we can often provide units in more neutral colors upon request, subject to availability. Please mention this when you book.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">5. How much notice do I need to give to place an order?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">For standard units, we can often accommodate requests with 24-48 hours' notice. However, to ensure you get the exact type and number of units you need, especially for specialty units like luxury trailers or for weekend rentals, we highly recommend booking at least 1-2 weeks in advance.</p>
